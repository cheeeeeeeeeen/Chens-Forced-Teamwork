Chen's Forced Teamwork is a mod that should enforce some challenges as a team.

- Kill everyone else if one of the players die.
- The first who enters the world will be assigned the Leader.
- Players far away from the leader will be forced to teleport back to the Leader.
- When one player uses a potion, everyone will be affected.
